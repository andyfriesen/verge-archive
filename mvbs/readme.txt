Monty Vecna Battle System Technology Demo
by Thrasher
------------
1. INTRO

Well, I just started getting good at coding 4 or 5 months ago. I decided I'd try 
my hand at a battle system, and I'd say it turned out pretty well, wouldn't you? 
There are many features of the demo.
------------
2. FEATURES

- Up to 4 monsters
- Random party pairing
- Random background color
- Different monsters to fight depending on level
- Boss at the end
------------
3. CONTROLS

Here are all the controls, and what they do.

ARROW KEYS: Change menu selections and enemy selections.
ALT: Bring up the menu.
ENTER: Confirm/go into submenus inside menu.
F2: Save game stats.
ALT-X: Quit to DOS.
------------
4. NOTES

The game officially will end after you beat the boss at level 30. For every five 
levels of the first character in your party, you'll get 3 new monsters to fight. 
Use the F2 button to save your progress. I enabled this because levelling up can 
be a long and hard process, and also, the demo will sometimes randomly crash. 
Sorry about the bad graphics; I did all of them but the character portraits 
myself. Also, if you get Thrasher in your party, RESTART. For some reason, it
saves his information incorrectly. The only thing that works for now is Attack, but be patient; I will probably get skills and items done soon.
