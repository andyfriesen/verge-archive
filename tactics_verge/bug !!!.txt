READ BEFORE TO TEST THE " LOOKING " VERSION OF TACTICS VERGE!  
  
I marked a bug whom I am not succeeds to correct again.  
Him it finds at the time of the menu of selection of the main 
character.  
If you choose the first character directly that you   
choose, at the time of the launching of the intro, there will be a
crash and the   
game will plant.  
To avoid it, I only found one means (for the meantime),  
it is to choose a character and to say NO at the time of the demand 
of choice.  
Then all will walk normally: you will finally choose your  
character !!
