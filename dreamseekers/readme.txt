DREAMSEEKERS
Alpha demo1.5

by Thomas Lipschultz (a.k.a. Wyrdwad)
(full credits contained in the demo itself)

Note: You can now skip the intro from a menu that will pop up when you
select "NEW" at the beginning!

Also note that the character shown in the intro is supposed to be Matthew
holding a baby -- I just have NO artistic talent when it comes to CHRs. (:

Please accept this version of Dreamseekers for what it is: a graphically
inferior attempt at beginning a VERY long and involving game. (: The CHR
character graphics and VSP tile graphics will be improved TREMENDOUSLY
by the time the game is released (and hopefully much sooner!).

d1.5 update: CHR art is still badly in need of improvement, but in the
Spring Glade section of this demo, all of the tile art is 100% original
and probably will NOT be changed very much by the final release. The
Festion section of the demo, however, is still in need of VSP alterations.

What to expect from future releases:

Demo2
Two (five?) new major characters introduced. One new
map added. FAR better graphics than before. (: New music added.
Menus completely redesigned. Item system completely redesigned.
Battle system added and implemented (but not completed).
FMV possible. Manga or mangas possible.

Demo3
Length of demo2 doubled. One more minor character introduced. Two more maps
added. May be longer than this prediction, too!

Beyond
Anything past demo3 can't be predicted right now. Just stay tuned, and find
out what's released!
