*** Attack of the Slimes ***

Well, this is our little submission for the 48HoV. It's a simple columns style game, though not quite columns. The controls are simple, Left/right to move, up to rotate and down to fall faster. Line up 3 slimes of the same color to clear them. Get combos to see witty messages. ;) 

Unfortunately, our tracker, Zaril, had to drop out at the last minute, so the music/sound effects you hear are all scrounged up from palces on my hard drive. Damn. :\

Um... yeah, that's about it. Hope you have as much fun playing this as we did making it! Enjoy!
