                  The Crumbling World - Chapter 1 through 2

_____________________________________________________________________________
0) Requierments and infomation

   TCW requiers a 486/33dx with 12 megs of real ram if you are running form
   dos or swap space if you are running from 95 and 10 megs of disk space.

   I xBig_D, Personaly recomend that you use a P90 with 24 megs and a sound
   blaster compitable.  I don't really recomend you running anything slower
   without a gus.  TCW does slow down on my p90 with my gus in certin areas.
   So be warned.

   TCW was developed on Hal.  Hal is a p90 with 24 megs or ram, 6.4 gigs in
   hd space, and a 2.5 meg Gus PnP.  TCW takes up over 100 megs.  Thats due
   to the uncompressed AVI's I use before converting.  Don't worry about
   that, because I don't give you the avi's b/c verge isn't 16 bit :P

   TCW was made by xBig_D and Kosh.  Ideas came from various games.  All music
   is from the mod archive execpt for the following
   - Jejanson.xm,  that is just a resampled and converted to a xm
   - victory.xm, Its a converted midi with no composer infomation

1) Installing

   First Download the game form one of the offical sites.

   http://www.dclink.com/stein/dg/
   http://moria.vivid.com

 a)Zipped Rars

   Then unzip the zip into a new directery just for TCW. (eg. e:\verge\tcw)

   Run unrar.exe x *.rar form the TCW dir or where the rar's are for the game.
   This should unrar it correclty.  Unrar.exe is included with this.

 b)Zip

   Unzip this game with -d (For pkzip) if you are going to unzip it.  I am now
   doing a zip version because of the amount of zipmagic users.  Allthough the
   zip is 1 meg bigger, it is not as confusing to install.  The chapter packs
   will still be rared for size reasons.


2) Running the game

   Just type main and your on your way.  DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN SETUP.CFG
   except for sound settings!  IF YOU DO, TCW's FMV AND GFX MAY BECOME
   SCREWED UP AND VERGE MAY CRASH ITSELF OR WINDOWS 95.  Most people should
   be able to run this without any changes in setup.cfg.

   Take out interpolate if you have a slower comptuer or change mixrate 44100
   to 22050 or 11025


   Here is the requiered commands in setup.cfg
   ----
   speeddemon
   vspspeed
   vcbuf 7500000
   ---


   Keys during a battle

   Space (B4) - Select
   Esc (B3) - Run Away
   Alt (B2) - Cancel form the items and magic menus

   Left and Right - Select Enemys
   Up and Down - Select Action


3) Installing new chapters

   Well, I Did alot of redoing to Ch1 when I did this version.  Chapter rars
   will be comming for Ch3 and so on.

   When you DL a new chapter I will just give you the rar.  You would type
   unrar x c:\where_ever_you_Downloaded_it\tcw_ch3.rar or ch4, etc (in the
   tcw dir, or else).

   Press 'a'll when it asks you to overwrite files.  This is improtant
   because some   chapters will use the same maps and it will need to have
   the latest in order for it to work.


4) Contacting Me
