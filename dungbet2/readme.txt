*** Hatchet's "Dungeon Master Engine" v0.2a ***

This is my oh so wonderful Dungeon Master engine. There isn't much to do right now, other than walk around the maze using the cursor keys. Mouse support, a slightly more optimized engine, player status screens and a revised layout are the latest features since the last version. 

Right clicking will bring up the status screen of the leader (unchangable currently), and right clicking again will close it. By right clicking on each player's "graph" boxes, however, you can open that player's screen. The exit and quit buttons both work, BTW. :)
