FF1 = Final Fantasy for the Nintendo Entertainment System

other than the strategy guide given by nintendo power ages ago (which has many
major errors and omissions), I've found very little information about this
game.  Nearly everything here I have discovered on my own

if you find anything amiss, missing, or badly explained (however trivial) with
this guide, e-mail me and I'll take a note of it.  E-mail me if you find out
any cool tips, strategies, etc...

======================= 0: DEFINITIONS & ABBREVIATIONS ======================

WARRIOR - one of the four members of your party, located on the right side of
	the battle screen

ENEMY - any character appearing on the left side of the battle screen.  An
	enemy of an enemy is a warrior.

S - STR - strength stat of a warrior
G - AGI - agility stat of a warrior
I - INT - intelligence stat of a warrior
V - VIT - vitality stat of a warrior
L - LUCK - luck stat of a warrior

D - DAMAGE - basic attack power of a warrior or enemy
H% - HIT% - accuracy stat of a warrior
A - ABSORB - basic armor rating of a warrior or enemy
E% - EVADE% - stat controlling ability to dodge attacks for a warrior

LV - LEVEL - experience level of a warrior
XP - experience points accumulated by a warrior

MHP - maximum hit points of a particular warrior

SL - spell level: each magic spell has a level associated with it from 1 to 8

SPELL CHARGE - each SL has a counter associated with it telling you how many
	spell charges remain that are available for use.  For each charge
	remaining you may cast a spell of that level one time

BASIC STATS - the statistics peculiar to each warrior which can be viewed on
	the left side of the status screen: S, G, I, V, L.  These stats are
	not affected by equipment

DERIVED STATS - the statistics on the right side of the status screen
	(D,H%,A,E%) which are completely determined by the level of the
	warrior and the basic stats.  These stats are modified by the
	equipment that the warrior has on

(a..b) - math notation representing a random integer picked between a and b,
	including a and b

[x] - math notation representing the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
	i.e.: [57/4] = [19.25] = 19

x=y(mod n) - math notation: modular arithmetic.  This means that x and y have
	the same remainder when divided by n.  i.e.: 3=7(mod 4),
	but 3<>7(mod 9)

a:(b..c) - my own personal mathematical notation.  This means that a is an
	integer between b and c, including b and c

" - substitute whatever is printed on the line directly above in place of the
	quote mark

CLASS - each warrior belongs to one of twelve classes: Fighter, Black Mage,
	Ninja, etc...

Fi/Kn - FIGHTER / KNIGHT classes
Bb/Ma - BLACK BELT / MASTER classes
Th/Ni - THIEF / NINJA classes
Rm/Rz - RED MAGE / RED WIZARD classes
Wm/Wz - WHITE MAGE / WHITE WIZARD classes
Bm/Bz - BLACK MAGE / BLACK WIZARD classes

PROMOTION - a change of class which all warriors recieve simultaneously at a
	unique point in the game, i.e. (Fi->Kn), (Wm->Wz), etc...

ARMED/UNARMED - whether or not a particular warrior has a weapon equipped

BARE/ARMORED - whether or not a particular warrior has any armor equipped.  If
		no armor is equipped, the warrior is bare

TARGET - the character to which an action is directed

ROUND - a complete cycle of a battle in which all warriors and enemies decide
	their courses of action and take that action

INSIDE/OUTSIDE - inside refers to any town or area that contains character
	whom you can talk to.  Outside refers to the world map

MONSTER LAIR - any place which contains enemies that you can run into and
	fight randomly

ELEMENTS/RESISTANCES - some magical and special attacks have one the four
	elements of fire(F), ice(I), lightning(L), or poison(P) associated
	with them.  If the target resists an element associated with that
	attack, damage taken is reduced.  If the target is weak against that
	particular element, extra damage will be taken

IMHO - 'In My Humble Opinion,...'




===================== 1: STATISTICAL & DAMAGE ALGORITHMS ====================

- - - - - - HOW THE BASE VALUES FOR DERIVED STATS ARE DETERMINED: - - - - - -

D = [S/2]	for Fi/Kn/Wm/Wz/Th/Ni/Rm/Rz
  = [(S+1)/2]	for Bm/Bz/(armed Bb/Ma)*
  = LV x 2	for unarmed Bb/Ma

*BUG: Immedately after a level up, D for an armed Bb/Ma is instead [S/2]+1.
	this is an actual effect and does not correct itself until you visit
	the weapons subscreen.  It even persists if you save and reload the
	game

H% = (initial value at LV 1) + (3 x (LV-1)) for Fi/Kn/Bb/Ma
   = (initial value at LV 1) + (2 x (LV-1)) for Th/Ni/Rm/Rz
   = (initial value at LV 1) + (LV - 1) for Wm/Wz/Bm/Bz


A = 0		for all classes, except...
  = LV		for a bare Bb/Ma*

*BUG: Immediately after a level up, A for an armored Bb/Ma is instead equal
	to LV, regardless of whatever armor is being worn.  This is an actual
	effect and does not correct itself until you visit the armor
	subscreen.  It even persists if you save and reload the game.  This
	bug does not affect special abilities granted by the armor you have
	on, such as resistances to certain elements

E% = G + 48%	for all classes



- - - - - - - - - - - HOW MHP CHANGES WITH EACH LV UP: - - - - - - - - - - - -

there are two types of level ups: weak and strong.
For a strong level up, MHP goes up by 20+[V/4]+(1..6).
For a weak level up, MHP goes up by [V/4]+1

for a given class and level, I'm not sure what determines whether the LV up
will be weak or strong.  Roughly speaking, over the course of 49 LV ups, the
six classes have the following percentages of strong LV ups:

Fi/Kn: 50%		Bb/Ma: 40%		Th/Ni: 35%
Wm/Wz: 30%		Rm/Rz: 25%		Bm/Bz: 25%



- INITIAL VALUES FOR STATISTICS AND HOW BASIC STATS INCREASE WITH LV UPS: - -

the first number in each space is the initial value given to that class at
LV 1.  The next number is the probability (in eighths) that that particular
stat will increase during a LV up.  i.e. a Black Wizard has a 3/8 chance of
gaining agility during a level up and an 8/8 probability of gaining
intelligence.  Basic stats never rise more than 1 point during a LV up.  The
H% and MHP rows tell you what the initial values of those stats are for that
particular class

	Class 	Fi/Kn	Bb/Ma	Wm/Wz	Bm/Bz	Th/Ni	Rm/Rz
STAT
  S		20,8	5, 5	5, 4	1, 4	5, 7	10,5
  G		5, 6	5, 5	5, 4	10,3	10,6	10,5
  I		1, 4	5, 5	15,5	20,8	5, 4	10,5
  V		10,5	20,8	10,4	1, 4	5, 4	5, 5
  L		5, 6	5, 5	5, 5	10,4	15,8	5, 5

  H%		10	5	5	5	5	7
 MHP		35	33	28	25	30	30



- - - - - - - - - - - - XP REQUIRED FOR EACH LV UP: - - - - - - - - - - - - -

to go from LV=N to LV=N+1, a warrior needs to acquire (39 x N^2) XP
if N>29, use N=29 in the preceding formula. 50 is the maximum level
attainable.  Add 1 XP to the XP needed if LV=1,17 or if (LV>22 and
LV=1(mod 2))



- MAXIMUM CHARGES PER SL AT EACH LV AND EXACT XP NEEDED TO REACH THAT LEVEL -

the number of max SL charges that a given warrior at a given level can have
can be found in one of the four columns corresponding to that warrior's class.
The Fi/Th/Bb/Ma classes have no capacity for magic

strangely enough, the Rm/Rz is given SL charges for SL-8 spells even though he
can't learn any SL-8 spells.  For this reason, the total # of SL charges that
I have listed on the right side will not include the SL-8 charges

the levels given for the Kn and Ni are relative levels.  Let X = either 22 or
the warrior's LV at time of promotion), choosing the higher of the two.  Then
+(n) in the LV column means that the warrior gets that SL capacity at
LV = X + n (if a Fi or Th were to get promoted after LV 43, that warrior would
never be able to reach his maximum SL charge capacity - this is usually not a
problem)

- - - - - - - HOW FF1 DETERMINES IT IS TIME TO ENTER BATTLE: - - - - - - - - -

at the beginning of the previous combat, a random number x is generated where
x = (50..255).  for each step taken

-outside on desert,plains,forest,marsh,river	decrement x by 6
-inside of a cave,or other monster lair		decrement x by 5
-outside on a ship				decrement x by 2
-on a damage square in a monster lair, in
  the airship, in a seaport, or inside		leave x alone

when x<0, battle begins.  There are also certain map squares for which battle
always occurs.  Entering a battle automatically in this way does not reset the
value of x.  In general, x is reset whenever x becomes negative or when a game
is begun or reloaded.  x is not reset by entering a town or other inside-type
area



- - - - - - - - - - - - - ENEMY DOMAIN MAPPING - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

the world map in FF1 is a grid 256 units wide by 256 units tall.  Label each
square on this map using X,Y pseudo-cartesian coordinates: (0,0) is the first
grid sqare in the NW-most corner,  (0,255) is the square in the SW-most
corner, (255,255) is the square in the SE-most corner, etc...

the entire world map is subdivided into 64 smaller (32x32) domains (it is
divided up with 8 strips legthwise and 8 strips up and down).  For each
domain, the enemies you can expect to find within are constant throughout that
domain.  The world map:

	   LAND:				   RIVER:
  (0,0)		      (255,0)		  (0,0)		      (255,0)
       N N X O O X N N			       B B B B B B B B

each letter represents type of domain and its relative position on the world
map.  For instance the 'B' in the center corresponds to a domain that spans
a territory from x:(128,159) and y:(128,159)

- - - - - - - - - - - the ACTIONS AVAILABLE in BATTLE: - - - - - - - - - - - -

FIGHT: attack an enemy
DRINK: use a HEAL or PURE potion on another warrior
MAGIC: cast magic
ITEM: use an item in that warrior's weapons or armor inventory as an item in
	battle.  Using items in this way doesn't destroy the item.  It is not
	necessary to equip the item or even to be able to equip it in order
	for a warrior to be able to use it as an item
RUN: run away from battle.  If any warrior in your party does this
	successfully, your entire party escapes

all actions which end up being targeted to dead or stoned characters are
ineffective.  Any action which is ineffective still uses the resources put
into the action, such as a spell charge or potion.  An action which is
interrupted due to incapacitation of the actor or early termination of battle
is considered to have never happened, and thus the resources put into it are
not wasted



- - - - - - - - HOW MONSTERS CHOOSE THEIR ATTACK STRATEGIES: - - - - - - - - -

for each action, a monster may do one of four things: ATTACK, use MAGIC, use a
special attack, or RUN.  If the monster doesn't run away, it chooses among the
other three options by a process I'm not sure of

if it chooses to attack, it chooses a target warrior

if it chooses to use magic(if it has that capability), it casts the next spell
available in its cycle.  Each monster has a unique circular list of magic
spells that always begins in the same place.  For example, the monster WzVAMP
uses the (AFIR,MUTE,ICE2,ICE2,LIT2,LIT2,FIR2,FIR2,...) magic cycle.  This
means that the first time WzVAMP casts magic, it will always be AFIR.  The
next time it casts a spell, it will cast MUTE.  After it gets around to the
second FIR2 spell, the WzVAMP would begin anew with AFIR (the next time it
chose to cast magic).  The monster's current position in its magic cycle is
completely independent of its current position in its special attack cycle

if it chooses to launch a special attack(if it has this capability), it does
the next one available in its cycle of special attacks.  This cycle works just
like the magic cycle.  Both cycles may run simultaneously but they don't
affect each another.  For example, TIAMAT (the temple of fiends version) has
the magic cycle (BANE,ICE2,LIT2,FIR2,...) and the special attack cycle
(THUNDER,POISON,BLIZZARD,BLAZE,...).  If the monster chose the strategy:
A,S,M,M,S,M,A,A,M,M, then it would attack, use THUNDER, cast BANE, cast ICE2,
use POISON, cast LIT2, attack, attack, cast FIR2, and cast BANE

if the action was an attack, or a magical or a special attack that was
directed towards a single warrior, the monster generates a random number,
x = (1..8).  If x:(1..4) the target of the attack is the warrior in front.  If
x:(5..6), the target is the second warrior.  x = 7 is the third warrior and
x = 8 is the fourth warrior.  If the target chosen in this way is dead or
stone at the time of the choosing, choose x again



- - - - - - - - - HOW DAMAGE IS CALCULATED FROM AN ATTACK: - - - - - - - - - -

if the attacker is a warrior, the maximum number of hits that can be landed
per attack is

N(h) = [H%/32]+1 for all classes, except...
     = 2 x ([H%/32]+1) for an unarmed Bb/Ma

when the attacker is an enemy, I presume it works the same way, but since I
have no way to test this, for each enemy I just give the value of N(h)

now, as some function of the attacker's H% and the defender E%, some of the
hits may be dodged... I don't know how this works

for each hit that gets through, damage done = (D..Dx2) - A, using the
attacker's D and the defender's A.  If the attacker is an enemy, there may be
a special effect when a hit is landed on a target warrior such as hit to stun,
hit to slay, etc...  I'm not sure what the chances of this happening are
either, but it is determined independently for each hit, so the more hits that
are made, the greater the chance that the defender will be afflicted with
something.  For any hit which does damage<1, damage done=1.  Now, if by chance
the hit was a critical hit, add Dx2 to the damage done.  I'm not sure what the
chances of getting critical hits are, but it increases with LV and basic
stats.  Getting a critical hit at least once per attack is in fact pretty hard
to avoid in the later stages of the game



- - - - - HOW DAMAGE IS CALCULATED FROM MAGIC OR A SPECIAL ATTACK: - - - - - -

every magical or special attack that does damage has a base power, call it M.
From this, the actual damage done = ([M/4]..M).  This damage cannot be
absorbed with armor.  If the target is resistant to the attack, damage done =
([M/8]..[M/4])*.  If the target is weak against the attack, damage done =
([3M/8]..[3M/2]).  Magical and special attacks which inflict damage never miss

*BUG: if a target is weak vs. a certain elemental, giving that target
	resistance has no effect - damage done is still applied as if the
	target was weak vs. that elemental.  For example, if a WzVAMP casts
	AFIR on a VAMPIRE, the VAMPIRE will still take extra damage from fire



- - - - - - - - - - - - HOW XP AND GOLD IS REWARDED: - - - - - - - - - - - - -

XP gained from battle is the direct sum of all XP values of monsters killed.
If there are N warriors which are not stoned or dead, each one of them gets
[(total XP)/N] experience points.  if this number = 0, XP gained = 1.  If XP
for any warrior exceeds 999999 at any time, XP = 999999

GOLD gained from battle is the direct sum of the GOLD values of all monsters
killed.  This is added to the party's GOLD supply.  If the GOLD supply exceeds
999999 at any time, GOLD = 999999



- - - - - - RELATIVE SPEEDS OF VARIOUS VEHICLES ON THE WORLD MAP: - - - - - -

walking ( = canoe speed)	= 2.1 steps/second
shipspeed 			= 7.5 steps/second
airspeed			= 15 steps/second



- - - - - - - - - CONDITION FOR STOOPING OVER IN BATTLE: - - - - - - - - - - -

if a warrior's HP<[MHP/4], that warrior will adopt a kneeling posture




================================ 2:CONDITIONS ================================

so far as I know, there are 7 conditions which show up as a status ailments
during battle.  In order of those of increasing severity towards the bottom of
the list, they are:
			MUTE (silenced)
			ASLEEP (asleep)
			STUN (paralyze)
			DARK (darkness)
			POISON (poison)
			STONE (stone)
			'    ' (slain)(dead)

The condition which will be listed on the status line will be the most severe
one.  Some of these conditions are not permanent and disappear at the end of
battle: these will be denoted 'nP'.  Others are permanent and stay with the
warrior until the condition is remedied, even if the warrior visits an inn or
saves and reloads: these are denoted with 'Pm'.  Any warrior which finishes a
battle with a permanent condition such as POISON, STONE, or death is
automatically switched with the warrior in the back of the party

MUTE(nP): all ITEM, MAGIC, and DRINK actions of a muted warrior will be
	ineffective (including the AMUT spell).  All magical or special
	attacks of a muted enemy will be ineffective
ASLEEP(nP): a warrior or enemy that is ASLEEP may only take action to try to
	break out of this condition.  A sleeping warrior will stoop over
STUN(nP): same as being ASLEEP
DARK(nP): seems to have no effect
POISON(Pm): outside of battle, a poisoned warrior will lose 1 HP with every
	step, whether the step is taken inside or outside (HP may not sink
	below 1 from this)(this damage is taken in addition to every HP
	that is lost from stepping onto a damage square).  In battle, the
	warrior loses 2 HP every round and may die because of this.  A
	poisoned warrior will stoop over
STONE(Pm): a stoned warrior may take no actions and may not be the target of
	enemy actions.  A stoned enemy dies instantly.  If all warriors become
	STONE or dead, your party perishes.  Stoning a warrior removes POISON
(slain)(Pm): a dead warrior may take no actions and may not be the target of
	enemy actions. Killing a warrior removes POISON.  To be dead is to lie
	face to the ground.  Death automatically sets HP = 0


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - RESURRECTION and INN RATES - - - - - - - - - - - -

costs for staying at an inn to restore all SL charges and HP for all warriors
(that are not stoned or dead) remains constant at a given location, no matter
what levels your warriors are at.  Resurrection is the same as casting the
LIFE spell on the dead warrior, and the cost of this also remains constant
throughout the game at any given location

Town: 	Coneria  Pravoka  Elfland  Melmond  CrescentLake  Onrac  Gaia  Lefein

RESURRECTION 40       80      200      ---        400       750   750    ---
INN	     30       50      100      100        200       300   500    ---




================================== 3:MAGIC ===================================

the capability to buy a particular magic spell for use in casting is
determined by character class.  The classes which are eligible to learn the 
spell are listed in the 'Who' column.  Some spells have different effects
based on whether combat is ensuing or not.  'Cb' in the 'Use' column means
that the described effect only happens if the spell is cast in combat.  'nC'
means that the effect only happens outside of combat.  If there is no 'Cb'
for a given spell and you attempt to cast it in combat, the spell will be
ineffective.  FF1 will not allow you to cast a 'Cb' spell outside of combat

damages listed in the 'Use' column are base magic powers.  Damages inflicted
from actual use are determined in the way explained in section 1.  An
elemental listed before the base power of the spell means that the spell
has that element associated with it.  i.e.: F20 means a power 20 magical fire
attack

contrary to what nintendo power says, weapons have no elemental attributes or
race multipliers in FF1.  i.e. the flame sword deals no extra damage to a
Frost D and the coral sword deals no extra damage against SHARKs.  Most
of the 'specialty' swords are actually completely useless and should be sold
immediately when they are found.  Weapons may have abilities when they are
used as items; this info is listed in the 'Use' column as the spell which has
the same effect.  Cost represents resale value, which is half of the buying
price if the weapon can be bought.  If the weapon can't be bought, there will
be a '!' after the resale value.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ARMOR - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

armors may have special abilities, such as granting the wearer automatic
resistance to certain elements, or immunities to certain spells.  resistances
are denoted by an 'r' before the element.  i.e. rF means that the armor grants
resistance to fire.

In addition, some armors can be used as items in battle.  This info is all
listed in the 'Use/special' column.  Most armors decrease E% somewhat, so all
E% values listed are negative.  There are four types of armor: armor(A),
shirt(T), and bracelet(B)(all three are types of body armor), shield(S),
hat(H), and gauntlets(G).  What kind of armor that each piece is is listed in
the 'Armor/Type' column

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - OTHER ITEMS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

items listed here are not carried by any one paricular character and thus have
a storage place other than that of either weapons or armors.  Following my
convention in the armor section, 'nC' denotes a use outside of combat, and
'Cb' is for the use of the item if it is used during combat

What	Cost	Use

HEAL	60	CURE(Cb), one warrior recovers 30 HP(nC)
PURE	75	PURE(nC/Cb)
SOFT	800	SOFT(nC)

(TENT, CABIN, and HOUSE may only be used outside):
TENT	75	all warriors recover 30 HP, and then the option to save the
		  game is given(nC)
CABIN	250	all warriors recover 60 HP, and then the option to save the
		  game is given(nC)
HOUSE	3000	all warriors recover 120 HP, and then the option to save the
		  game is given; if the game was saved, all warriors then
		  recover all of their SL charges(nC)*

*BUG: magic is not restored until after the game is saved, so the benefits
	of using the HOUSE are not saved;  if you reload the game, it will
	go back to the point before all SL charges were restored, and thus
	you will have wasted a HOUSE.  To avoid this, save the game twice by
	using a TENT or CABIN immediately after using the HOUSE.  If you have
	to reload later, you will then return to a point where you had full
	magic power

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - SPECIAL ATTACKS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

as is described in the battle algorithm section, some monsters have the
capabilities to launch special attacks.  There are two attacks that are called
POISON but which have different effects.  One of them is used only by JIMERA
and is labelled as such.  Effects are explained using the same conventions as
in the magic section

What		Effect

BLAZE		F220 to all warriors
BLIZZARD	I200 to all warriors
CREMATE		F100 to all warriors
CRACK		slay all warriors
DAZZLE		stun one warrior

FLASH		darkness to all warriors
FROST		I100 to all warriors
GAZE		stun one warrior
GLANCE		stone one warrior
HEAT		F50 to all warriors

INFERNO		F384 to all warriors
INK		darkness to all warriors
NUCLEAR		400 to all warriors
POISON		P260 to all warriors
POISON(jimera)	poison all warriors

SCORCH		F30 to all warriors
SNORTING	darkness to one warrior
SQUINT		slay one warrior
STARE		80 to one warrior
SWIRL		256 to all warriors

STINGER		poison all warriors
THUNDER		L300 to all warriors
TRANCE		stun all warriors



- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ENEMY STATS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

the 'D' column has info about the basic attack power of the enemy, the number
of hits it makes per attack, and special effects of the attack, such as: hit
to stun(S), hit to sleep(A), hit to poison(P), hit to put in darkness(D), hit
to stone(T), and hit to slay(K).  For example, K:1x9 means that the enemy
attacks with 9 hits, each hit having a damage base of 1 and having the
capability of slaying the target instantly (this would be a pretty nasty
attack)

the 'Strategy' column tells what extra actions are available to the enemy
(magic(M), or special attack(S)) and the cycle(s) that the monster
follows, as explained in the battle algorithms section.  All enemies have the
option to attack

the 'Weak/Immune' column refers to spells and elements which the enemy is
especially vulnerable to.  i.e. wL means the enemy is weak vs. lightning
attacks, and w(STUN,SLEP) means that the enemy is especially vulnerable to
the spells of STUN and SLEP.  Also listed are element which the enemy resists,
and spells which are ineffective against that enemy.  For example, rI means
the enemy resists ice attacks and i(BANE) means that the enemy is immune to
BANE.  All undead enemies have weak/immune of wF,rI,i(RUB,BANE,BRAK,STUN,SLEP)
as is denoted in shorthand by a '#' in this column

============================ 6:TIPS,TRICKS,ETC... ============================

to get to the puzzle game within FF1, board the SHIP and press A,B at the same
time, 55 times in a row.  You may return to the main game at any time by
pressing B

to view the entire world map and your location on it, push and hold B, then
press SELECT.  This only works if you are outside

if you have a Bb/Ma character in your party, the armor BUG explained in the
algorithms section can be helpful or disastrous.  If your Bb/Ma is at a low
level, but has a lot of armor on, and you put him in front, the next time he
gains a level, the BUG will take effect, lowering A to A = LV of the Bb/Ma.
In other circumstances this bug can work to your benefit: if you want to have
the advantages of the RIBBON and PRORING for your Bb/Ma but also want a
reasonably high ABSORB value without having to equip body armor, just equip
the PRORING and RIBBON and then take a LV up.  As long as you don't check your
armor screen, the A of your Bb/Ma will be equal to his level.  You will
also still have space left over for armors that can be used as an items in
battle.  Just be sure that the armos are all in the proper places before
taking the LV up

for cheap HP restoration, use TENTs whenever possible near the beginning of
the game.  Later, collect the HEAL(staff) and 2 HEAL(helmet)s in order to heal
HP during battles against weak enemies.  And if you can, buy the HEL2 spell.
Due to the BUG explained in the magic section, this spell has the effects of a
HEL3 spell if you cast it in battle.  This makes it a very useful spell to
have during the middle of the game when you fight enemies with strong attacks

due to a BUG in the domain mapping on the world map, it is possible to fight 
ZomBULLs, FrWOLFs, and other strong enemies at the northernmost tip of the
peninsula east of Pravoka.  This peninsula is directly south of Lefein and is
the point of closest approach between the southern and northern continents.
If you have the spells of FIR2, HRM2, and a bunch of TENTs, you can gain lots
of GOLD and XP here very quickly early in the game

to gain experience rapidly and safely later in the game (after you have the
AIRSHIP), first equip all your warriors with PRORINGs.  Now go back to the Ice
Cave to the point where you found the FLOATER.  As you will remember, this was
guarded by the EYE.  Since a battle with the EYE always ensues whenever you
step onto the square before the treasure, you can fight the EYE repeatedly as
often as you want without having to go anywhere.  With all warriors wearing
PRORINGs, the XXXX spell that the EYE uses will be ineffective, and you can
easily kill the EYE with weapon attacks in the first round.  There is some
danger that one of your warriors will fall prey to GLANCE, but you can protect
yourself against this as well, if you equip your warriors with RIBBONs.  At
a rate of four battles won every minute, you can expect to LV up for all
warriors every ten minutes

IMHO, the RIBBON is easily the most useful piece of armor in FF1.
There are 3 of them to be found: one in the Waterfall, one on B2 of the Sea
Shrine, and one on 5F of the Mirage Tower/Sky Castle.  The RIBBON grants the
wearer automatic resistance to all four elements, and this can mean the
difference between life and death near the end of the game



- - - - - - - - - - Pros and Cons of the 6 character classes - - - - - - - - -

Fi/Kn: characters in this class have phenomenonally high A values, thus they
	are good to have in the lead positions where most of the attacks land.
	They are pretty good at attacking, and have usually have the highest
	MHP.  They are expensive to equip in the first half of the game, which
	can really slow down the action, and later on, if you have too many
	Fi/Kn characters in your party, you may find that you have no free
	spaces in your weapons and armor inventory to put new stuff.  The Kn
	class can learn the AFIR and ALIT spells, which are useful sometimes

Bb/Ma: this character class is very cheap to equip and fights incredibly well
	when UNARMED.  At level 50, a FAST Bb/Ma can theoretically do 20 hits
	for 8000 points of damage to a single target, and thus kill CHAOS with
	a single attack!  Open spaces on the inventory screens mean lots of
	space to put extra armor and weapons that can be used as items or
	resold.  A Bb/Ma cannot use magic, has a below average armor level,
	and an above average MHP level

Wm/Wz: this character can use of of the WHITE magic spells and is most useful
	for restoring HP or preparing defenses in a hurry.  The Wz is much
	valued for his ability to cast the EXIT, LIFE, and LIF2 spells, which
	are indispensible for long journeys into monster lairs.  A Wm/Wz has a
	low attack power and armor level, and an average MHP level

Bm/Bz: this character is very useful for his BLACK magic elemental damage
	spells in the early parts of the game.  If this magic is used
	properly, it is possible to defeat bands of enemies much stronger than
	your own party and thus gain loads of experience very quickly.  The
	Bm/Bz class can also use FAST, which is very useful against boss type
	enemies.  A Bm/Bz has a pathetic attack and armor level, as well as
	very little MHP, making his class the least survivable class there is

Th/Ni: this character has the best chance of trying to RUN away in battle.
	There isn't much else to say in favor of this class until it gets
	promoted to the Ni class.  The Ni has an above average armor level and
	an average attack power.  Like the Kn, you may find that the Ni
	frequently has no space to carry spare pieces of armor.  The Ni can
	cast FAST, which helps a little.  The Ni has an average MHP level
	There are no really good reasons that I can think of to include this
	class in your party, but if you really want to, it doesn't hurt you

Rm/Rz: this class is just about the most useful spellcaster you can have in
	your party(but not good enough to be substituted for the Wm/Wz class).
	The Rm/Rz can cast EXIT, LIFE, HEL2, FAST, all of the elemental damage
	spells, FOG2, AFIR, AICE, and ALIT, to name a few useful spells.  The
	Rm/Rz has an average attack power and armor level.  MHP for this class
	initially rises quickly, but levels off sharply, resulting in a below
	average MHP level overall.  IMHO, this class is superior to the Bm/Bz
	class, and unless you really like the idea of being able to cast a
	spell with the name NUKE, you're better off using this class instead
