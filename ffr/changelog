1/08/2001:
- Modified the World map and its Tiles a little bit.
- Added Character Naming. You'll be asked to name the
  characters as you select them.
- Added Equipment, as well as the Equip Menu! Weapons
  and protective gear!! You'll receive all the existing
  equipment once you appear in Cornelia, so you can
  test it. Try to equip something unequipable by
  certain character! Also set the "honored" variable
  to 1 (press ` and then type "sv honored 1") so you
  are able to equip the strongest equipment. Shops will
  come soon (now there IS a point for working on them).
- Added Items Menu! All Items work. Try them! You'll
  receive 99 of each item at the begining of the game
  so you can test them. Also, you'll get some of the
  plot items (which are usable too).
- Added some new CHR files (Female Ninja, Boy Monk,
  unfinished Girl Fighter), and finished some of the
  unfinished ones (Boy Thief, Male and Female Monks,
  Male Ninja).
- Added Save Game capability. Only one savefile, just
  like the original FF1. If you want to have multiple
  savefiles, just hit Alt+Tab, enter your favorite file
  manager (e.g. Windows Explorer), open the game folder
  and rename the "savegame.dat". Warning: Savefiles won't
  work between versions, since I'm always optimizing the
  game, adding and removing global variables, etc. (If you
  know how savefiles work, you'll understand).
- Finally added the "Order" routines. Now you can change
  your characters' order, and the walking character is
  replaced with the one on the first party index.
- Optimized the Stats and Level Up code to be a bit closer
  to the original FF1. Also added some new stuff for the
  Inventory and Equipment code.

10/09/2000:
- Removed Kisha's message. I guess it annoyed everyone.
- Optimized the Mode 7 code.
- Added a function to generate windows. You can use either
  gradients or images as background. More will come later.
- Added Config Menu. You can now change the window
  background, change the message speed, turn off the text
  sound (it annoys almost everyone). The option to change
  the window border will be added anytime soon.

9/11/2000:
- Documented the "Intro Skip" key (Alt). It has always been
  there, but I guess few people figured out.
- Kisha added a message for everyone.
- Finished the Level Up code and added fake battles! Check
  your Experience after each!
- Added Male Fighter and Thief CHRs.
- Mosaic Fade In and Out!
- Did some work with the tiles. Look for yourself!
- Added Mode 7 effect for the World Map. Can't remember the
  Coder's name, sorry!
- Started work on the Item and equipment stuff. Check items.vc
- Added some new songs to the game directory: Castle Music and
  Victory Fanfare, Castl_RM.S3M and Victory.XM respectively.


6/19/2000:
- Added Ninja CHR.
- Modified the World Map a bit.
- Rearranged the Status screen.
- Optimized the Menu code and "Cursor Memory" (cursor keeps
  last position).
- Modified Character Selection screen. Now has all the spaces
  for the selectable characters (but nor the characters).

6/05/2000:
- Changed the Intro song. The Prelude song is now complete.
- Added two CR2 (Male Monk and Male Red Wizard) to the game.

  menu items.

  player's Current Position. !!yek M eht sserP
- Added "Map not available" message for those who try to
  enter Cornelia Castle and/or The Temple of Fiends.


5/29/2000:
