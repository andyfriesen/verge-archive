Final Fantasy Reprise
Introduction Text


The world is veiled in darkness.
The wind stopped blowing,
the heaven no longer gave rain,
the sea is wild,
and the earth began to rot.

The people waited, but things
never got any better.

Their only hope, a Prophecy:
"When the world is in darkness,
the Warriors of Light would come..."

Then, five warriors appeared.
They all came from Lephein,
the most advanced civilization.
They were powerful but...
they failed.

Entire civilizations were destroyed:
Lephein's Sky Empire,
The Mermaids' Sea Shrine,
The Dragon Knights from Ordeal...
They all are just legends now.

When all hopes were lost,
four young warriors arrived,
each holding a Crystal,
which glowed centuries ago,
and is dark now.

Though they were young,
they are strong, brave,
and determined.

No one has ever seen them before...
Where'd they come from?
Are those kids the...
Warriors of Light?

They are now in Cornelia, resting
after their long journey.

And so, the story begins...
