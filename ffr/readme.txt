Thanks for Downloading!

This is the Public Alpha Demo of Final Fantasy Reprise.

  This game is being developed for the love we have for the
Final Fantasy Series. If you love the Final Fantasy Series
too, and want to contribute to our project, go on! Remember
this is not a "Play Only" demo. It contains the WHOLE directory,
incluiding all the unfinished/unused stuff, the VC files, the
non-coverted PCX, etc. so you can help us develop the game.

Q. Are the trees going to stay chopped off?
A. No. How could you think the trees would stay like that?

Q. The town looks ugly! Can't you finish the tiles?
A. We are concentrating in more important things right now.

Q. Why are the Shops and buildings empty?
A. Same as above.

Q. Are you going to change the plot too dramatically?
A. Well, do you think we should? If we find it necesary, we will.

Q. Do you have a release date for the Full Version?
A. That's the most stupid question we've been asked. No!!!!!

Q. Do you have a Battle system?
A. The Experience and Level Up Code is finished. The Items
   are finished. The Equip routines are finished. Haven't
   started work on the Battle system yet, but most of the
   necesary things are done already. Expect it shortly.

Q. Why do some entities disappear?
A. They are not disappearing. They are still there, but the CHR
   isn't finished. What you see are "blank" frames.

Q. Is there a way to skip the Intro text?
A. Yes. It has always been there. Press Alt.
