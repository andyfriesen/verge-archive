The world is veiled in darkness.

Four Fiends appeared:
Tiamat, the Fiend of Sky
Kraken, the Fiend of Water
Kary, the Fiend of Fire
Lich, the Fiend of Earth

The wind stopped blowing,
the heaven no longer gave rain,
the sea wildened,
and the earth began to rot.


The people waited, but things
never got any better.

Their only hope, a Prophecy:
"When the world is in darkness,
the Warriors of Light would come..."


Then, five warriors appeared.
They all came from Lephein,
the most advanced civilization.
They were powerful but...
they failed.

The Fiends destroyed entire civilizations:
Lephein's Sky Empire,
The Mermaids' Sea Shrine,
The Dragon Knights from Ordeal...
They all are just legends now.

When all hopes were lost,
four young warriors arrived,
each holding an Orb,
which shined centuries ago,
and is now dark.

Though they are young,
they are strong, brave,
and determined.

No one has ever seen them before...
Where'd they come from?
Are those kids the...
Warriors of Light?

They are now in Cornelia, resting
after their long journey.

And so, the story begins...
