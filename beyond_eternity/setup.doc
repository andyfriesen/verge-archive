Quick guide to using SETUP.CFG.
===============================

Available commands:
joystick: 0 for disabled, 1 for enable. Default 0.
sounddevice: 0 for autodetect, 1 for GUS, 2 for SoundBlaster, 3 for NoSound
mixrate: somewhere between 11000 and 41000
forcemono: forces mono sound output
force8bit: forces 8-bit sound output
dmabufsize: sets the DMA buffer size for SB output.
interpolate: tells the sound driver to interpolate data. Higher sound quality
             for a speed hit. (only applicable to SB cards)
waitvrt: 0 for disabled, 1 for enables. Default 0. Use if the fade flickers
         or if you get "shearing" on your video card. This mostly happens on
         older computers, most newer machines are immune to the effects, and
         as waiting can slow down the engine quite a bit, it defaults to
         disabled.
vspspeed: Drastically speeds up the foreground layer, but at the cost of
          using twice as much VSP memory.
end: ends the SETUP.CFG. IMPORTANT - engine will just poll endlessly unless
     this is present.

===========================================================================
MEMORY ALLOCATION - You can now specify how much memory Verge allocates to
certain areas. For instance, a VSP can now handle up to 65535 tiles. This
means that a VSP that used all of that data could take up 16 megs. It would
be ludicrous for me to allocate ALL of that data for VSPs when most VSPs
wouldn't actually use more than 1000. This new set of commands allows you
to tailor memory allocation needs specifically to certain game.

vsp: Determines the size of VSP data buf. I'd recommend at least 256000.
map: Determines the size of MAP data buf. I'd recommend around 150000, but
     beware that this number is actually multiplied by 5 to compensate for
     the total MAP info. (150000 would support a 300x500 map)
mapvc: Buffer for map-based VC code. (Does not include combat VC code)
       Around 50000 would be nice - perhaps more if a map contains a
       LARGE amount of text.
vcbuf: amount of memory allocated for VC Data Buffer, defaults to 250000.

===========================================================================

CONTROL COMMANDS: The controls are now configurable. Here's how to set them
up currently.
Up/Down/Left/Right buttons are NOT changable. :)

However, Verge recognizes four "virtual" buttons. These are simply termed
b1, b2, b3, b4. The general rule-of-thumb:

b1 - Accept/activate/talk/etc.
b2 - Cancel
b3 - System Menu
b4 - Main Menu

You can set up which keys and joystick buttons really go to these buttons.
The joystick set of commands are simple. For instance:

jb1 4     Would set virtual "b1" to what's really joystick button 4.
jb3 2     Would set virtual "b3" to what's really joystick button 2.

The keyboard equivalents are similar. The commands are kb1,kb2,kb3,and kb4,
as you would guess. However, the numbers they take are a bit different.
These have to be the actual hardware index of the keys. Here's a table:

ESC          EQU 1

Hope this helps. The defaults are that all joystick buttons are just b1=1,
b2=2, etc. The current keyboard equivalents are:

b1 = ENTER
b2 = ALT
b3 = ESC
b4 = SPACE

But of course these are all completely changable now. :)
