# Colour options:
#  The default pallete is the same as the old verge
#  palette. If you'd like to load your own palette,
#  use this variable. Approximate default colours will
#  be chosen for the interface, but you can alter them
#  with the colour variables if you don't like them.
PALETTE = "MQ.PAL"

#  Colour variables can be set to any number between
# 0 and 255, variables are: COLTEXT, COLDTEX, COLHIGH,
# COLFACE, COLDISB, COLSHAD, COLLIGH, COLFEAL, COLFEAS
#  Experiment to find out their uses.

# Mouse Options:
#  If you've altered the palette, the mouse will often
#  look strange, so you can choose the option of a
#  simple mouse instead, or your own custom mouse.
#  This custom mouse can be the top left 8x8 square
#  in a PCX file. Color 0 will mask. Make sure it
#  uses whatever palette you use.

# Default new CHR Options:

# HOTWIDTH and HOTHEIGHT are also allowed, but they
# are not used in the actual engine to my knowledge

# Editing options:
GRID = OFF
# ZOOM = 0
# Zoom is commented here so the program can
# automatically maximize the zoom. Valid numbers
# for zoom are 0,1,2 and 3.
