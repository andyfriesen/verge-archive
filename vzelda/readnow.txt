                   (in Timeline format)

Year: 1000 YoH (Year of Hyrule)
A hero, named Link, defeats the evil forces of
Ganon and gains the powers of the TriForce.

Year: 1030 YoH
A mysterious wizard named Bugen, with a strange
ability to float in mid-air, comes to the land of
Hyrule.

Year: 1050 YoH
Link dies of old age this year. His two sons, a wizard
named Glenlin and a warrior, oddly named Twig, turn
thirty.

Year: 1080 YoH
The wizard Bugen, who is still living, grows in power;
Glenlin dies of old age, and Twig dies of old age the
following year. Glenlin's son, named 'Wyrdwad', turns
ten this year as well.

Year: 1100 YoH
Bugen gets the grasp of a mystical power of the Circuforce
(something to do with the Triforce :), a magical force called
VERGE, which allows him to create evil worlds and make
'entities' to do his bidding. Princess MoonCrush,
a descendant of Zelda, is captured. Wyrdwad, now 30
years old owner of the privately-owned document
"Top 100 ways to flirt with MoonCrush", goes out to
save her.

(The "Bugen says" is what I'm saying. The "Translation"
 is the same thing put bluntly and exaggerated. :)

Bugen says: I made this in a few days, including
            fixing up bugs, etc., etc.
Translation: I slapped this piece of crud together
             in 5 minutes and then uploaded it.

Bugen says: It's still a bit buggy, but I hope you
            like it.
Translation: See above translation.

Bugen says: The final game probably won't be
            very long -- I'm trying to take a
            break from my 'mystery product'
            (a serious game) and making a funny
            VERGE game.
Translation: I'm too lazy to make a long game,
             so I'll just hurry up and beat
             McGrue for first completed VERGE
             game (that's over 5 minutes long,
             no offense to the maker of Caveman
             Village :-)

Bugen says: This is not the secret project that
            I've been keeping under wraps for
            awhile -- that should be coming
            soon, tho.
Translation: I'm trying to keep one of my
             projects secret to increase hype.
             This isn't it.

Bugen says: E-Mail me with what you think, at
            web-kid@rocketmail.com
Translation: E-Mail the weirdo and be honest.

Bugen says: The "translations' are j/k -- I did
            spend a few days on this, and I'm
            not a weirdo. :)
Translation: What Bugen said.

Artwork: Spram*, Hahn*, Bugen**

Battle system by: Silencer***

Almost Everything else by: Bugen****!

* - I merged Hahn's hahn01.vsp and Spram's nature.vsp
    for this demo.
** - I did two tiles -- one in all black and one in
     all red. ;) Death.vsp is mine. :)
*** - I used Silencer's Real-Time battle system for
      this game, with some bug fixes. Also, both
      the main character's CHR and the Guard CHR
      are taken from his demo.
**** - There's a Bugen that's the enemy of this game,
       and the Bugen that's writing this -- don't get
       the two mixed up ;)
